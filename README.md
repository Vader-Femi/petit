 To be added later

It supports png, webp, jpeg, jpg, heic, and heif formats. So I added an error massage for unsupported formats. I also found out that the webp compression is not very effecient.

A Flutter image compression application capable of compressing images in various formats, like HEIC, HEIF, PNG, and JPG, for efficient storage and faster file transfers without compromising quality

- [Image Picker] to select images to compress both locally and cloud (on android)
- [Flutter Image Compress] for compressing WEBP (may not be efficient), PNG, and JPG
